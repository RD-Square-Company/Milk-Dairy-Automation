# Milk-Dairy-Automation
This project is based on milk dairy automation with Qt (C++)

Synopsis
Project:   Milk Dairy Management System

Introduction:
	This project will make all processes and transaction of Milk Dairy available online and save time by doing all needed calculation on milk data. It will help people to easily store their milk data and analyze it. This System will contain different Roles* of users so that they can be restricted to access particular contents of data. 
*(See last page for more details on Roles of user)
Objective: 
	Milk Dairy Management (MDM) System includes open source software and SMS/Messaging. MDM will not support only any single dairy, it will work with many dairy and individual seller at single time. MDM will connect dairy with its branches. It will help in data handling in milk dairy and at home. It will provide different role to see and access data differently at different time and place. This system will have an admin panel so that admin can be able to control on different role, manage users and change settings when login as an admin. This project is to help a large community of people to record their milk data and give them ease to track record, make payment etc.
Technology Used:
•	C++
•	QT ( provides GUI using C++ for software)
•	SQL  using MYSQL ( for database system)
•	HTML, CSS ( for software development)

Team Details:
	Total team strength: 3
	Total number of modules: 3
	The team would be divided to work on each module. Each of the team members will play separate roles during the development of their modules. They would acts as leads or team members for the different modules. Once they code their modules they will be responsible to integrate their module with other modules developed parallel by the other team members. They should have to run testing/checking phase at last to make sure that module-integration is working properly. After the integration part is over the whole team is responsible to deploy the project on QT and Server. At each step of deployment a testing/checking phase will be undertaken to make sure that the functionality is working properly.
Target Audience:
	This project would be useful for milk dairy and person who sell milk to Milk Dairy or to another person and for person who buy milk from Milk Dairy or from another person. It will also helps person who doesn’t have smart phone by sending bills or messages on his/her mobile in his /her own language. Very large population of India is residing in village so this system will target from a businessman to a layman person residing in the corner of any village in India. Online data record and billing system will help people to see their bills and data from anywhere.
Market Potential and expected popularity:
	This project will help in digitalization of India by targeting from rural area to urban area. As the availability of software and application and messages in the all possible local languages help people to use this system easily. Its flexibility of handling its user and transaction of Milk Dairy in different way will maximize its efficiency. It will provide all data of any single dairy together. This will also helps government to understand where the production of milk is more.
Current status of Project:
	Selecting teams and assigning module to team member. We will working on survey, and it will be conveyed soon.
